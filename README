ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Importing Required Libraries
Before starting the project, we import all the necessary libraries that will be used throughout the workflow.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Loading and Exploring the Dataset
We read the dataset file and inspect its structure.
Check for any missing values and handle them accordingly to ensure data consistency.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Shuffling and Splitting the Data
To reduce overfitting and improve generalization, we shuffle the dataset.
We split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that the "sku" column is stratified to maintain class distribution.
The processed train and test datasets are then saved for further use.


ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Changing Train & Test Files
At this stage, you can switch between different training and testing datasets to experiment with different scenarios.


ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Data Preprocessing (The Most Critical Step)
In text classification, preprocessing plays a major role. We apply multiple Arabic text normalization and cleaning steps:

Basic Arabic Preprocessing:
Normalize different forms of the same character (e.g., Ø¥, Ø£, Ø¢ â†’ Ø§).
Keep only Arabic and English letters and essential characters.
Remove repeated characters in a sequence (e.g., "Ø¬Ø¯ÙŠÙŠÙŠØ¯" â†’ "Ø¬Ø¯ÙŠØ¯").
Split numbers from words (e.g., "ab123cd" â†’ "ab 123 cd").
Handling Common Misclassifications:
Initially, our model struggled with some medicines having multiple written variations.
Example of misclassification issue:
Ø§Ø¬Ù…Ù†ØªÙŠÙ† 20 Ø¬Ù… Ù‚Ø±Øµ Ù…ØµÙ†Ø¹ Ø³
Ø¨Ù†Ø¯ÙˆÙ„ 30 Ø¬Ù… Ù‚Ø±Øµ Ù…ØµÙ†Ø¹ Ø³
Ø¨Ù†Ø¯ÙˆÙ„ Ø´Ø±ÙŠØ·
To solve this, we removed measurement units (Ø¬Ù…, Ù…Ø¬Ù…, etc.) as it doesn't affect the result also if 2 different classes have it , it may leads to miss classifcation .
We unified words with similar meanings (e.g., Ù‚Ø±Øµ, Ø§Ù‚Ø±Ø§Øµ â†’ Ù‚Ø±Øµ). (we have made this in many words like ÙƒØ±ÙŠÙ… ØŒ Ù„Ù…Ø¨ÙˆÙ„ ØŒ Ø¬ÙŠÙ„) we made this to prevent missclassification as an exmaple we have 2 classes c1 and c2 ,  c1 was trained with data have word Ù‚Ø±Øµ and c2 have trained to data have word Ø§Ù‚Ø±Ø§Øµ if we test a new medicine related to c1 but it have word Ø§Ù‚Ø±Ø§Øµ it may misclassify also it have the same menning .
